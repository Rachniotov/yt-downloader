<h2>Known issues</h2>

<details>
<summary>My last half of the video is not working</summary>
<br>
As there isnt any kind of a progressbar, you might just tap on download and close it right away, you dont have to do so.
You need to give it some time to download large mp4 files. If you stop the app in midway, your video will be corrupted.
